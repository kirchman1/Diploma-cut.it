# My graduation project

The essence of my project is link clipping (we insert a link and a code word, and at the output we get a link shortened by the code word). 

The page includes: 
- authorization and registration system with DB;
- several static pages (homepage, about us);
- dynamically updated and stored in the database links, entered by specific users.
